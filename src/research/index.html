        With the increase of cyberbullying, sexual harassment, and hate speech on social media, there is an increased need to 
        identify and combat risky behaviors. Most of the previous research in this space is
        predominantly focused on isolated aspects of online risk detection and often lacks a complete view
        of the problem. For example for online risk detection systems, it is crucial to ensure that the models
        and systems developed can effectively address real-world challenges, as online spaces are continuously
        evolving. There is a need to collect datasets that mirror the complexity and diversity of the online
        environment, encompassing various platforms, including their multimodal nature, subtle nuances,
        contextual information, and evolving trends. In light of these changing dynamics, my research takes
        a comprehensive approach to detecting and reducing abusive behavior online.

            Collection of Ecologically Valid Datasets
        </h2>

            My research emphasizes the need for collecting ecologically valid datasets for accurate predictions in real-world scenarios [1].
            For example, my studies on youth risks on Instagram published at CHI’22 [2] and sexual risk detection (CSCW'23) [3] highlight the importance of including victims’ genuine experiences.
            I integrate annotations provided by the youth themselves, allowing their lived experiences to shape the dataset.
            Additionally, I explore both the public and private aspects of youth’s online lives [2]. This emphasis on authentic data collection contributes to reliable risk detection solutions.
